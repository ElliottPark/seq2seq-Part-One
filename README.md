# seq2seq-Part-One

The code in this repo is taken from the Udacity deep learning github repo:

https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/blob/master/seq2seq/sequence_to_sequence_implementation.ipynb

It's been modified it to work with a few other data sets in order to demonstrate how sequence to sequence neural networks work when applied to a variety of tasks.
